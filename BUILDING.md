# Building Aurora locally without GitHub

## Build Dependencies


- [just](https://github.com/casey/just)
- [podman](https://podman.io/)/[docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [jq](https://jqlang.org/)
- [cosign](https://www.sigstore.dev/)

<sub><sup>Everything is included in any Universal Blue image</sup></sub>


## Examples

| build command | produced image |
| ------- | -------------- |
| `just build` | `localhost/aurora:latest` |
| `just build aurora stable` | `localhost/aurora:stable` |
| `just build aurora-dx stable nvidia-open` | `localhost/aurora-dx-nvidia-open:stable` |

## Rebasing to a locally built image

For `bootc` to see the new image it has to be moved from users container-storage to the container-storage of the root user like this:

```
podman image scp localhost/aurora:latest root
```

```
sudo bootc switch --transport containers-storage localhost/aurora:latest
```

and lastly reboot into the new image

```
systemctl reboot
```

# Testing fixes without building an image

## Fixes that don't need a reboot

Makes `/usr` writable for this boot

```
sudo ostree admin unlock
```

Use `dnf5`/make whatever modification to `/usr`

```
sudo dnf5 -y downgrade somepackage-6.9.1-1$(rpm -E %{dist})
```

reboot to undo any changes you made

## Fixes which need to survive a reboot like firmware downgrades

```
sudo ostree admin unlock --hotfix
```

This will make the current deployment writable and will make it work like any other deployment as well

```
rpm-ostree status
```

```

                 Unlocked: hotfix
```

```
sudo dnf5 -y downgrade atheros-firmware-20250311-1$(rpm -E %{dist})
```

To get rid of the writable deployment you can either just (wait for an) update and it will get cleaned up eventually or you boot into the previous deployment from Grub and run:

```
rpm-ostree cleanup --pending
```
